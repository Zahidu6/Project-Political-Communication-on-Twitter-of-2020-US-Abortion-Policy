Being Pro-Life is not extreme, defending abortion all the way up to partial-birth abortion is. The SCOTUS ruling on Roe did not change any laws. It upheld the Constitution &amp; gave state legislatures the ability to write their own laws to represent the values of their state.
The president's call to destroy Senate rules over the abortion ruling is an assault on the separation of powers. It‚Äôs an attack on an independent judiciary. It would worsen division, democracy will ease it, as Justice Kavanaugh points out. I strongly disagree with the president.

Today is a monumental day for the protection of life in America and a defining moment for our nation. Roe v. Wade was wrongly decided, and the Supreme Court has corrected a historic injustice.
Today, @SCOTUS reversed its 1973 Roe v. Wade decision, which I have long-believed was unconstitutional. This is welcome news. It is our moral and ethical duty to protect the dignity of human life, particularly when it comes to the unborn. https://t.co/lTd8uqL2HA
Today is a day for which millions of Americans ‚Äî myself included ‚Äî have worked and prayed. Overturning Roe v. Wade is a turning point in our nation's history that will undoubtedly save millions of lives and open the door to greater legal protections for the unborn.
Precedents that are wrongly decided should be overturned, just as Brown v. Board of Education was right to overturn Plessy v. Ferguson. This ruling is a win for the unborn, the Constitution, and democratic governance.
The U.S. Supreme Court‚Äôs ruling on Dobbs v. Jackson Women‚Äôs Health Organization restores the American people‚Äôs ability to determine abortion laws through their elected representatives, as the Constitution requires.
