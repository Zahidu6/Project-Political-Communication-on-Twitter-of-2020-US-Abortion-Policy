The #FourthofJuly is a day to celebrate freedom. Admittedly, it’s hard to celebrate freedom after #SCOTUS revoked the fundamental constitutional protection to an abortion, the first time I can remember that the court purposefully revoked rights, rather than expand them.
Abortion is a standard part of health care. Bans, criminalization and bounty hunter laws will not stop abortions. Instead, many women will be forced to resort to unsafe practices of the pre-#RoeVWade era.

History will show the #DobbsvJackson decision as one of the worst decisions of #SCOTUS. Congress, @POTUS and state governments must take action to protect the reproductive and health rights of Americans.
Throughout my time in Congress, I have been a steadfast supporter of reproductive rights, and this will not change. I will continue to work to ensure that women can access the care that they need.
Today is the 57th anniversary of Griswold v. Connecticut, the #SCOTUS case that guarantees the right of families to have access to contraception and family planning.

This decision established the right to privacy for married couples and later played a crucial role in #RoevWade. https://t.co/f9yJ1aBERM
Right now, b/c of #SCOTUS, people across dozens of states are scrambling to gain access to basic reproductive health care. Dobbs overturned 50yrs of legal precedent &amp;declared the govt can force someone to carry a child to term even if circumstances &amp;medical advice says otherwise.

The #FourthofJuly is a day to celebrate freedom. Admittedly, it’s hard to celebrate freedom after #SCOTUS revoked the fundamental constitutional protection to an abortion, the first time I can remember that the court purposefully revoked rights, rather than expand them.
Abortion is a standard part of health care. Bans, criminalization and bounty hunter laws will not stop abortions. Instead, many women will be forced to resort to unsafe practices of the pre-#RoeVWade era.

I refuse to let my daughters grow up in a world with fewer rights than I had.
 
Now is the time for the Senate to codify Roe v. Wade into law so that every American in every state has equal access to basic, necessary healthcare—regardless of their skin color, zip code or income.
Doctors working in states where abortion, or even management of a miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy, is outlawed could even be threatened with prison for daring to save a patient’s life. Victims of rape could be forced to relive their trauma every day.
Millions of families—including my own—have relied on Roe v. Wade for almost 50 years. The Justices who claimed Roe was “settled law,” but then turned around and ruled otherwise, will—as Justice Sotomayor said—"struggle to survive the stench" of this extreme decision.
I am outraged and horrified—this outcome is a nightmare that robs women of their right to make their own choices about their healthcare and their bodies, and it paves the way for a nationwide abortion ban that Republicans have been seeking for decades. https://t.co/7lX4gVfSIn
If Republicans have their way, victims of rape and incest could be forced to go through pregnancy and birth and relive their trauma over and over. 

Where's the humanity in that?

Roe v. Wade must stand.
If Roe v. Wade falls, make no mistake: it could pave the way for the nationwide abortion ban that Republicans have been after for decades. 

Even when the mother's life is at risk. Even in cases of rape and incest. 

Codifying Roe can't wait.
Forcing births on anyone—even when the mother’s life could be at risk—is not only cruel, it could be a death sentence. Codify Roe v. Wade into law.
As we await the SCOTUS decision that could roll back reproductive rights for millions, Republicans are also working to throw patients and doctors in jail for seeking or providing care.

@PattyMurray and I are leading a resolution to PROTECT access to full reproductive care.
If Republicans have their way, doctors who are working in states where abortion—or even management of a miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy—is outlawed could be threatened with prison for daring to save a patient’s life.

This is anything but pro-life.
While @SenateDems stand up for women and reproductive freedom, MAGA Republicans are scheming to take rights away from millions of Americans for the first time in our nation’s history. It’s unforgivable.

In overturning Roe v. Wade, the conservative Supreme Court majority indicated it's willing to attack other constitutional rights, including same-sex and interracial marriage. One justice specifically noted that the Obergefell decision should be revisited.

The U.S. is one of only 13 countries in the world where the maternal mortality rate is worse now than it was 25 years ago. The tragedy of maternal mortality is more pronounced when considering women of color are 3x more likely than White women to die as a result of pregnancy.

@JudiciaryDems will explore the grim reality of a post-Roe America in a hearing next month. The Court’s decision to erase the right to an abortion will not only lead to the denial of critical health care services, but also criminal consequences for women &amp; health care...
The bottom line: on critical, personal choices involving a woman’s right to make reproductive decisions about her own body, do you trust her or the gov't? The Supreme Court now says a woman’s right to privacy does not extend to the most personal, private choice she'll ever face.

It threatens not just a woman’s physical health &amp; control over her own future, but it also threatens to put women &amp; their doctors in jail.
If #RoeVWade falls, women and their doctors could be put behind bars.

We must protect reproductive health care at all costs. This is a battle we simply cannot afford to lose.
If Roe falls, it’s up to Congress to protect reproductive rights.

Inaction is not an option.
#OnThisDay in 1965, the Supreme Court recognized that the right to privacy includes access to birth control.

Griswold v. Connecticut expanded reproductive freedom to millions. We need to continue to defend that right today.
With reproductive rights under attack, we must protect the privacy of women seeking abortions.
https://t.co/u9yDvcJeAs
We should never sit by as the Supreme Court considers taking away a right to contraception.

Our Right to Contraception Act will codify this constitutional right and protect access to all reproductive health care.
Those serving in our military deserve access to reproductive care no matter where they’re stationed.

Joined @gillibrandny’s MARCH Act to ensure servicemembers have access to safe, legal abortion.

We must protect those who protect us.
Over half of women who have an abortion will use medication. They often receive it by mail.

Our Protecting Access to Medication Abortion Act will make sure those pills remain accessible in states where abortion is still legal.
Anna’s story is just one example of the lengths women now have to go to for reproductive care.

At the very least, we must protect them and their doctors from prosecution. https://t.co/rzr4BzVrvg
Women from all over are coming to Colorado for abortion care.

Our Freedom to Travel bill will ensure they can’t be prosecuted for crossing state lines. https://t.co/5XmA4fyS95
Republicans just blocked our bill to protect women who cross state lines for an abortion.

Threatening jail time for seeking reproductive care is a stain on this nation.
Tune in LIVE as we urge passage of our bill to protect every woman’s right to travel for reproductive care: https://t.co/Z6VNGd5GtA
As surrounding states ban abortion, women are coming to Colorado seeking care.

At @HELPCmteDems we discussed how that can stretch providers and access to other reproductive care. https://t.co/Z2odF07HTl
Decades ago, my mother fought to protect reproductive freedom because she understood how important abortion care is to a woman's ability to make her own life choices.

We must restore that freedom today. https://t.co/Y5jMOI5g8s
We've joined 3 reproductive rights bills that will:

✅ Protect women who travel to CO &amp; other states
✅ Ensure military servicemembers can access reproductive care
✅ Codify access to abortion pills

Now let’s vote!
Protecting reproductive rights isn’t about politics. It’s about freedom.
We will always fight for reproductive freedom. Always.
Our service members deserve access to safe reproductive health care, no matter where their military service sends them. https://t.co/lrRJDKKyL2
Reproductive rights should be protected, not stripped away.
In a post-Roe era, these deceitful tactics will put women’s lives at risk.

We’re urging @Google to end misleading search results for women seeking reproductive health care.

The floodgates are open for states to begin prosecuting abortion.

Congress must pass the Women’s Health Protection Act.
Americans should have access to contraception regardless of where they live. That’s why today I cosponsored legislation to codify Americans’ right to contraception.
Virginia’s laws protecting abortion access should stay in place. But Republicans are trying to roll them back and make the state less accommodating to women. This issue is not only about abortion, but about respect for women. We need to respect women to make their own decisions.
Americans should be guaranteed the right to health care, including making their own reproductive decisions. That’s why I’m trying to find a path forward to codify a federal guarantee of reproductive freedom.
A ten-year-old rape victim in Ohio had to travel across state lines so she could access abortion care. When we tried last week to pass the Freedom to Travel for Health Care Act to protect her and all women’s right to travel across state lines to access care, Republicans objected.
I’m cosponsoring this bill to protect a woman’s right to cross state lines to seek abortion care. This is critical to helping women access the reproductive health care they need—regardless of their zip code. https://t.co/37HNkvM2gj
How each state treats reproductive freedom post-Dobbs is a direct measure of whether that state respects women. https://t.co/l6y1lEHrCn
Whether states protect or eliminate abortion access will send a clear message about their respect for women. Profound implications. We have to make sure Virginia maintains its laws protecting choice.
The wildly out of touch Supreme Court has ruled that reproductive decisions aren’t worthy of constitutional protection but must be matters for legislative action. That’s why I’m working with colleagues to craft a federal guarantee of reproductive freedom.
We need more Democrats in the Senate to help us codify Roe v. Wade. Volunteer, donate, vote this November: https://t.co/Ly8qHc7fdA
Abortion is still legal in Virginia, but Governor Youngkin wants to ban it after 15 weeks, and Republicans in Congress want to implement a national ban on abortion. I’m working in the Senate to protect the right to choose legislatively—we’re not going to stop pushing for this.
No way. This proposal would restrict Virginians’ access to reproductive freedoms—taking us backwards and harming women across the Commonwealth. Virginia shouldn't roll back women's rights. https://t.co/l61YNFpxz3
The successful GOP effort to block consideration of Merrick Garland and jam through Justice Barrett has produced a Court wildly out of touch with the deeply held beliefs of Americans on reproductive freedom, gun safety, environmental protection, and so much else.

The court opinion today is an outrage. It will result in a patchwork of laws across the country. Women in TX shouldn’t have less rights than women in MN. We must put Roe v. Wade into federal law and to do that we must win the elections in the fall.

This a strong move in the fight to protect reproductive freedom.

But Congress needs to end this fight once and for all and codify the right to choose in law.

Republicans in the Senate continue to block debate on legislation to codify reproductive rights, but they can’t block the will of the American people. The Senate must act at once to protect the constitutional rights of every woman across the nation.
Today, six radical-conservative Supreme Court Justices gave Republican lawmakers final say in the reproductive and health care decisions of every woman in America.
The hardest part of every negotiation is letting go of the perfect for the possible. My focus is on saving lives. Each life we save means everything to their loved ones.

And if we can find agreement right now on action that will save even one life, it’s action worth taking.
President Biden’s executive actions will help safeguard access to reproductive health care and patient privacy.

This is an all-hands-on-deck moment.
 
I’m committed to defending the right of Arizona women to make their own health care choices.
Today’s decision is a giant step backward for our country.
 
It's just wrong that my granddaughter will have fewer freedoms than my grandmother did.

RT @Maggie_Hassan: Mitch McConnell, Kevin McCarthy, and Mike Pence are all pushing for a national abortion ban. 

My opponents’ records are…
The GOP agenda - criminalize abortion, ban gun control, deregulate business, and pollute more - is super unpopular.

So Republicans stopped trying to enact it in law and instead nominated politicians to the bench to get their agenda enacted by the unelected, unaccountable branch.
A reporter posted on Facebook “If you send me your address, I will mail you abortion pills.” Within a minute, Facebook took down the post.

Then she switched the words “abortion pills” with “a gun”. Facebook did nothing. The message stayed up.

No joke. https://t.co/PLahWuIIQq
Let’s be 100% clear. If Republicans win control of the House, Senate and White House two years from now, they will pass a national abortion ban. And no matter where you live, no matter how pro-choice your state is, women and doctors will be locked up for practicing health care.
These guys are just politicians. The Constitution to them is just a fun tool to help them impose their political views on the entire country. The implausible inconsistency of the guns and abortion rulings is both sickening and revealing.

The #Dobbs decision will have immediate &amp; catastrophic consequences for women &amp; families. By overturning #RoevWade, SCOTUS has opened the door for politics to interfere in private health decisions.
My family’s abortion story is difficult to share, but families experience similarly heart-wrenching situations every day.

Oregon’s strong protections that give everyone access to abortion care are still on the books in the wake of this devastating and dangerous Supreme Court decision. I’m focused on making sure we pass a law to ensure everyone across the country can get the care they need.
I’ve led the charge on filibuster reform for years—we need to get the Senate back to working order to make progress on the issues we all care about, including protecting Americans’ right to make their own health care decisions by protecting access to abortion care for all.

I’m grateful to be from Oregon—where we’ve protected the right to abortion care in state law. But that state law can be wiped out by a national abortion ban—and Mitch McConnell says he will seek to pass just such a law if Republicans win control of the Senate. I will fight this.
Now, that attack is not a possibility, but a reality. It is now up to every state to defend reproductive rights, but so many states are headed in exactly the opposite direction. This is a mega-calamity for the rights of Americans.
Earlier this spring, we saw the fear, anger, and uncertainty across the country stemming from the callous and dangerous draft Supreme Court decision that attacked women’s reproductive rights.

We absolutely have to fight back against Republicans’ cruelty. The stakes could not be higher. That's why I led Senate Democrats in urging @POTUS to do whatever he can to protect abortion access. I was glad to see him take steps to do so last week, but there’s more to be done.
That's why at today’s hearing, they’re going to see exactly what their cruelty means for women seeking abortions. This isn’t just about whether you’re ready to raise a child. Pregnancy is a life-changing medical procedure with physical &amp; mental tolls. For many women, it's deadly.
I've been warning for YEARS about Republicans’ attacks on reproductive rights putting lives at risk—&amp; I'm far from the only one. For so long, women, providers, &amp; patients nationwide made clear that the overturning of Roe would be devastating. But Republicans don’t care.
Republicans’ response to this devastation is to work to be even crueler. They're talking about:

❌A federal abortion ban
❌Putting women and providers in jail
❌Banning travel for abortion
Republicans’ cruelty has already been devastating. States have banned abortions for any reason. Health care providers risk jail time for doing their jobs. Patients can’t get life-saving medications. Women live with deep uncertainty for their futures.

Your work and bravery in the midst of constant attacks is so important. Thank you.

For years we’ve fought to protect reproductive rights in MD. But far-right lawmakers in states across the country are trying to pass laws that target doctors for doing their jobs &amp; send bounty hunters after those seeking care in MD or elsewhere. We can’t let this stand. https://t.co/D6kFKGOnJH
Far-right states are attacking reproductive health care from all angles, some even banning the right to choose w/o exception for rape &amp; incest. @POTUS' EO will help protect vital medical procedures, interstate travel, &amp; Americans’ health info. But we must codify Roe v Wade. https://t.co/g280GMIO8l
Richard Trumka spent his life fighting on behalf of workers &amp; their right to organize. He was an unstoppable force, &amp; I was proud to stand w/ him in this fight. As @POTUS posthumously honors him today w/ a Presidential Medal of Freedom, his legacy continues to drive us forward. https://t.co/nuiEVisPWh
This is the reality of the Republican agenda: Taking us back 100 years and blocking access to reproductive health care. We cannot let them keep pushing our nation backwards. https://t.co/Liy3z3BVhp
A lot to get done in the next few weeks. Looking forward to voting on CHIPS, welcoming Finland and Sweden to NATO, and getting something done on drug pricing. I’m hoping we’ll take action on codifying marriage equality and reproductive care as well. Let’s get it done.
It’s frankly unbelievable that we’re living in a political climate where access to contraception – a broad range of medicines prescribed for many purposes – is a partisan issue. I fully support a woman’s right to access health care.
I’m joining the fight to increase funding for reproductive health services like birth control, cancer screenings and more. I refuse to wait on the sidelines while reproductive choice is taken away – I’m taking action to try and help women to access the health care they need.
Last week, I made visits across the Valley and the Highlands to listen to folks’ concerns. I consistently heard fears about inflation, reproductive rights, and broadband coverage – and I’m back in Washington ready to work to address those.
Some states are willing to do anything to restrict abortion – including outlawing the freedom to cross state lines to access health care.
 
That would be unacceptable and likely unconstitutional, so I’m joining with colleagues to introduce a bill to protect the right to travel.
Senate hearings are turning towards abortion over the next few days.
 
The difficult reality is that we don’t have the votes in the Senate now to codify Roe.
 
But I’m not going to give up on looking for ways to protect access to abortion, birth control, and health care.
I intend to keep standing up for a woman’s right to choose – that’s why I’ve led advocacy to Google and cosponsored a law that would crack down on abortion-related search results. There’s far more to be done, but this is an important start.
I’m devastated to read stories about doctors consulting lawyers before providing abortions to women in dire health conditions. Private medical decisions are always best made between a woman and her doctor.
I will keep working to protect access to care – that’s why I’ve joined my democratic colleagues to push on @POTUS to take action. I’m a proud cosponsor of the bill to codify Roe. And I’ve been advocating that the Google CEO rein in misleading abortion-related search results.
The Dobbs opinion disrupts 50 years of settled law and endangers women who need abortions for nonviable pregnancies. Putting the responsibility on doctors to potentially face criminal charges for assisting a miscarrying mother is very dangerous.
For them and for all Virginians and Americans, I will continue working to protect needed access to safe, legal abortion. (4/4)
America already struggles with disproportionately high rates of maternal and infant mortality – especially among women of color. If SCOTUS restricts access to abortion, that problem will worsen.
I’m mindful every day that Roe could be overturned. I’m not just going to wait &amp; hope for the best – so I led my colleagues to advocate that the Google CEO rein in misleading abortion-related search results so folks can easily access accurate information.
Women looking for accurate resources about abortion shouldn’t have to wade through deceptive search results about fake clinics.
 
That’s why I led a letter to the Google CEO asking them to limit or label results for scam clinics.
NEW: @RepSlotkin and I are leading a group of lawmakers to push on the Google CEO to crack down on manipulative search results that lead to scammy “crisis pregnancy centers.”
 
It’s time for them to limit or label results and ads that lead to fake abortion clinics. https://t.co/LlkTueI2QP
On this day in 1919, the Senate passed the 19th Amendment – a monumental step forward for women’s rights.
 
I’m disappointed that 103 years later, the Senate is stalling on both protecting the right to vote and a woman’s right to access abortion.
Protecting life means supporting commonsense gun control. It means capping insulin copays at $35/month. It means voting for funding for COVID vaccines. It means not criminalizing abortion when the mother’s life is in danger. 

This is what I am working towards.
A lot to get done in the next few weeks. Looking forward to voting on CHIPS, welcoming Finland and Sweden to NATO, and getting something done on drug pricing. I’m hoping we’ll take action on codifying marriage equality and reproductive care as well. Let’s get it done.

The GOP has made it clear that they are coming for contraception following the disastrous reversal of Roe v. Wade.

Senate leadership should put this bill on the floor so the American people can see where their lawmakers stand on trusting women to make their own health decisions. https://t.co/Jl45uVI8f7
They opposed a role meant to support women so they could pass a faux litmus test on abortion. Extreme party politics are seizing control of our urgent policy priorities and it has to stop. The lives &amp; safety of these women are more important than any talking point.
Deciding whether to start or grow a family is one of the most important decisions a woman makes. It belongs to her – not the government.

 I’m helping to lead the fight to keep it that way w/ the Right to Contraception Act, which will protect &amp; expand access to contraceptives.

26 states have or will soon ban abortions. That means many patients are now being forced to travel across states to access abortion care.

The GOP failed women &amp; patients across America today by blocking the Freedom to Travel for Health Care Act, led by @SenCortezMasto.

These are important steps to help preserve access to abortion &amp; repro services in the wake of the devastating Roe reversal.

SCOTUS’ ruling is not the end of our fight for #reprohealth – we must channel our outrage into action. I’ll never stop defending women’s right to abortion or access to reproductive care in New Hampshire &amp; across the U.S. 

https://t.co/NwhZsQbT4z
13 states have automatic triggers laws that will ban abortions within 30 days, with more to follow.  

My heart goes out to women and those whose essential health care has just been ripped from them.

We cannot accept this dangerous new status quo.
https://t.co/Ef8EhAqsDk
The highest court in the land failed half of the country today. Like millions of Americans across the country, I am gutted &amp; horrified. 

Make no mistake: Overturning Roe jeopardizes women’s lives. It won’t stop abortions from happening – it will just make them dangerous.
If #Roe is overturned, trigger laws will close over a quarter of the country’s abortion facilities. 

That means millions of women would be without access to life-saving health care. 

We must protect fundamental reproductive freedoms.
https://t.co/uD7nB4N2NL
Accessibility to safe abortions is under attack by extreme partisan Republicans, which is why this expansion of care is very welcomed news.

✅ Deploy federal, state, and local medical personnel to areas of need.

✅ Facilitate reproductive care for people who need emergency assistance.

✅ Speed up research, information-gathering, and state projects to promote reproductive care.

This would allow the Administration to:

✅ Authorize doctors to provide reproductive care in other states.

✅ Help out-of-state Medicaid patients access reproductive care.

✅ Protect patient access to medication abortion.

Crisis pregnancy centers outnumber legitimate abortion care providers 3 to 1 in Massachusetts. @MassAGO Healey is sounding the alarm about their deceptive practices. We must do everything we can to protect Americans seeking reproductive care. https://t.co/Xi408800It
The Supreme Court's decision to overturn #RoeVWade is going to impact everybody in America. But it'll fall the hardest on low-income people, women of color, and people who've been raped or abused. This extremist court is out of touch with what the American people want. https://t.co/iT6M1RSZnm
In Massachusetts, so-called crisis pregnancy centers outnumber legitimate abortion care providers 3 to 1. We need to crack down on the deceptive practices these centers use to prevent people from getting abortion care, and I've got a bill to do just that.

Mike Pence has cut to the bottom line: he &amp; his Republican cronies won’t rest until abortion is criminalized nationally. My message: I’m not going to rest fighting that threat &amp; until a woman’s right to control her own body is fixed into federal law.

The ultimate recourse for the American people is to expand majorities in the House and Senate that will do whatever it takes to codify Roe into law. Congress must also act to protect Americans' data so it can't become tools of the prosecution in abortion cases.
These radical Justices have ensured American women today have fewer rights than their grandmothers had decades ago. To be clear: the anti-abortion movement won’t stop here. What’s next is the criminalization of abortion – women and doctors in jail.
This is a heartbreaking day for America. Today’s radical decision to overturn Roe v. Wade tosses out a half century of legal precedent, curtails the fundamental rights of women, and jeopardizes the health and safety of millions of people across the country. https://t.co/CsomJGKTaQ

Yesterday, the Supreme Court effectively threatened marriage equality, contraception, and the LEGALITY of same-sex relationships. Americans do not want to lose these freedoms, but the Court and its dark money donors have the power to take them. That is horrifying.
On top of that, the Biden administration must take all possible steps to protect women’s reproductive and constitutional rights – including the right to travel to access reproductive care.
We have to fight back, and swiftly:
a. The Senate must immediately pass the Women’s Health Protection Act to codify Roe v. Wade
b. We must also repeal the “Hyde Amendment”—a misguided law that prevents federal dollars from being used for abortion care
Justice Thomas made it crystal clear: he wants to overturn the Court’s decisions protecting the rights to contraception, same-sex marriage, and same-sex intimacy.  Expect to see conservative activists leap at this invitation. https://t.co/eMcVyaZz7k
And this right-wing project is not limited to abortion. The FedSoc Six are paving the way to roll back more constitutional rights.
Here’s what Republicans will target next:
a. Republicans in Congress are talking about a national abortion ban
b.  Also on the agenda is prosecuting women for getting an abortion (or trying to)
c. They’ll try to ban women from traveling to other states to get reproductive care
And it won’t stop there. We already know that states like Texas will even come after anyone who helps another person get an abortion, whether that’s donating to a GoFundMe or driving them in an Uber.
Abortion is now banned, or will be almost immediately, in 13 states with “trigger” bans, and 13 more states are poised to follow suit. These bans mean providing abortion care is now criminalized, with harsh penalties or imprisonment for doctors and medical professionals.
The Supreme Court has been captured by special interests, and they aren’t going to stop with overturning Roe v. Wade. Here’s what West Virginia v. EPA could unleash: https://t.co/VDKWVrj0IM
